# Overview

This is a comprehensive Telegram bot that provides multiple AI-powered services and utilities. The bot serves as a multi-functional assistant capable of text generation, image/video analysis, background removal, YouTube video search, and movie information lookup. It integrates with several external APIs including Google's Gemini AI, YouTube Data API, TMDB (The Movie Database), Remove.bg, and Google Vision API to deliver a rich user experience through Telegram's messaging platform.

# System Architecture

## Bot Framework Architecture
The application uses the `python-telegram-bot` library as the core framework for handling Telegram interactions. The main entry point (`main.py`) sets up the bot application with command and message handlers, implementing a clean separation between the bot interface and business logic.

## Service-Oriented Architecture
The system follows a modular service-oriented design with dedicated service classes for each external API integration:

- **GeminiService**: Handles AI text generation and image analysis using Google's Gemini AI
- **YouTubeService**: Manages video search functionality via YouTube Data API
- **TMDBService**: Provides movie search and information retrieval from The Movie Database
- **RemoveBgService**: Handles background removal from images using Remove.bg API
- **VisionService**: Analyzes images and videos using Google Vision API with Gemini fallback

## Handler Pattern
The bot implements a handler-based architecture where different types of user inputs (commands, text messages, media files) are routed to appropriate handler functions. This design allows for easy extension and modification of bot capabilities.

## Configuration Management
Environment-based configuration is centralized in a `Config` class, managing API keys and application settings. This approach ensures secure credential handling and easy deployment across different environments.

## Error Handling and Fallback Strategy
The system implements graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms, particularly for image analysis where Gemini serves as a backup when Google Vision API is unavailable. Error handling is centralized through utility functions that format user-friendly error messages.

## File Processing Architecture
Temporary file handling is implemented for processing uploaded media, with size validation and format checking to ensure system stability and security.
